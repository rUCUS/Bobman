# Bobman
java assigment from four buddies where we are supposed to create a interactive game.

We decided to create a rough copy of the game Bomber man and we called it Bob man after a inside joke that is not 
relevent at the moment.

Basicly the game sets up in a way that you and your buddy spawn in each corner of a rectangelur maze with many
solid and destructible walls. Your objective is to kill each other by throwing bombs and one of the 
ways to obtain that is by destroying the walls to eventually get to each other and meanwhile trying to get
as many powerups as possible to prepare yourself.

To spice up the game a bit and not make it a full copy of the old bomberman we decide to give the users a chance to 
decide how they want to initially start by giving them the options to chose characters that have diffrent attributes 
that may give them the advantage or disadvantage in certain fields. We are trying to program it so it will be fair regardless
of who you may chose as a character.

We also made sure to create powerUps that gives you diffrent types of bombs which will help your chances to win,
for exempel we have the power up to make your bomb ratio bigger.
